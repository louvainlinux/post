## Important notice
Because this repository has not seen any activity in more than two years, it has been **archived** by the Louvain-li-Nux team in november 2019. It is now read-only, but you can still fork it. The terms of licence still apply.

This will be the new post install process. Currently, have to complete the routes and make the angular interface (so, still a lot of work to do). (Also have to clean up some code. Will do it when everything is running).



notes: 

first connect to mysql from command line
then SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0
then SHOW TABLES and DROP TABLE <table_name>
then SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1
