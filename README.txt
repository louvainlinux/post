This will be the new post install process. Currently, have to complete the routes and make the angular interface (so, still a lot of work to do). (Also have to clean up some code. Will do it when everything is running).



notes: 

first connect to mysql from command line
then SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0
then SHOW TABLES and DROP TABLE <table_name>
then SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1
